# Resources for developers

This information will be useful for those creating ArchivesSpace plugins,
contributing to the core codebase, or integrating ArchivesSpace with other
systems. Additional documentation is available to provide a [technical
overview](../technical-overview) of ArchivesSpace and for evaluating
technical requirements and capabilities for [installing, configuring and maintaining](../application-management)
an ArchivesSpace instance.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
_If you discover errors in the documentation, or would like to suggest
or contribute additional documentation, please submit an [issue](#) or
[pull request](#) as appropriate._
